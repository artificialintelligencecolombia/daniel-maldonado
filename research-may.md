[Link text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

- Basic sections for a webpage
.header: h1
.navbar: navbar 
.main content: main (it has subsectionas represented by article, section, div)
.sidebar: aside, often placed inside main (we'll use aside in main webpage only)
.footer: footer

- Html elements in more detailed description

.main is different from page to page.It shouldnt be nested within other elements.
.article: nested content related to itself and need no relationship with
the rest of the pase.
.section is for grouping articles.
.aside: not main content info but provides additional information (could contain links)
.header
.nav: contains the navigation functionality through the webpages.
